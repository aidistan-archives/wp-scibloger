== Description ==

= Main features =

A list of features provided by now,

* LaTeX Support
* Post Outline Generation

= LaTeX Support =

This function is realised by importing copy of **MathJax**, an open source JavaScript display engine for mathematics that works in all browsers, from their CDN Service.

Simply use \\(...\\) to wrap your in-line math or \\[...\\] to wrap your equations. For more info, please visit MathJax [Homepage](http://www.mathjax.org/) or [Documents](http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/).

= Outline Generation =

Posts on science usually are long works. SciBloger will help you generate a useful outline as long as headers were set properly: making h3 the top level in your post; h4s, h5s, h6s follows by order.

Shortcode is also supported to generate outline more flexible:

[scibloger_outline show="yes" right="10px" top="20%"]
